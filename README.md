## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python

Welcome to this repository, where you’ll find a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. EDA is an essential step in the data science process, enabling you to uncover insights, identify patterns, and make informed, data-driven decisions.

### What's Inside?
📈 Visualisations: A variety of data visualisations created using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas to explore trends, distributions, and correlations.<br>
🧩 Statistical techniques. <br>
📑 Insightful commentary and explanations to guide your own analyses.<br>
📁 Datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset

You're welcome to use the code for personal or commercial projects.<br>

### Work in Progress
🚧 This repository is an ongoing project, and I'll continue to add new EDA scripts, datasets, and insights regularly. Keep an eye on this space for updates and improvements.

### Contributing
Feel free to submit pull requests to add more EDA techniques or improve the existing ones!

Happy exploring and analysing your data!
